    <h1>What is MvM?</h1>
    <p>Mann vs. Machine is a co-operative game for Team Fortress 2 that lets you and five friends wage a desperate battle to stop a lethal horde of robots from deploying a bomb in one of Mann Co.â€™s many strongholds. Take advantage of breaks between waves to upgrade your abilities and weapons. Survive all the waves in any of a variety of missions to earn incredible loot.</p>
    <p>This site is used as a guide to help you through your MvM Missions. We will go over the best load outs for each class and as well as what each class is great for and what jobs they are usually doing. We will also go over the tours and what type of loot to expect from each tour and as well as which one might be the best to do.</p>
